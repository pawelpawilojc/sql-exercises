# SQL Database Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of SQL exercises using the **Sakila** database on the **MariaDB** engine. The exercises cover: basic queries, data manipulation, joins, subqueries, DML (Data Manipulation Language), DDL (Data Definition Language), and aggregate functions.

These exercises were completed as part of my **Database** course at **DSW University of Lower Silesia** (Uniwersytet Dolnośląski DSW).

## Repository Structure

The exercises are divided into multiple sections based on different SQL topics:

1. **Basics** – Simple queries to introduce basic SQL operations such as `SELECT`, filtering results, and retrieving unique values.

2. **Joins** – Exercises involving table joins (`JOIN`), allowing data retrieval from multiple related tables in the Sakila database.

3. **Subqueries** – Exercises using subqueries to extract data based on other query results.

4. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** – Queries that modify data in tables, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and view creation.

5. **DDL (Data Definition Language)** – Commands to create new database structures, such as tables, along with defining primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

6. **Aggregate Functions** – Queries that utilize aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`) to analyze data.


## About the Sakila Database
The Sakila database is a sample database developed by MySQL, commonly used for learning SQL. It includes tables that model a movie rental business, such as actors, films, categories, customers, payments, and more. This repository uses key tables from Sakila to demonstrate various SQL operations.

## Requirements
To work with the queries in this repository, you need:
- MariaDB or MySQL installed.
- The Sakila database (available for download from [MySQL's official website](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html)).
